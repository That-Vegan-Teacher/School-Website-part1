 <h3>Soaring Towards Excellence</h3> 

<p> Welcome to the New Year! The last two years have undoubtedly been challenging with the COVID-19 situation affecting everyone.
grow. SMBSS Staff have innovated through Home-Based Learning endeavours as well as pedagogies adapted to the
safe management measures put in place. SMBSS Students have risen to the challenges and responded 
cexceptionally with the same hunger to learn and experience the joys of schooling, by adapting to the various modes of
learning and other new social norms. Let’s continue to cultivate this Growth Mindset as we embark on another school year. Where COVID-19 forced us to Survive in 2020, we Thrived in 2021, and we should strive to Prosper despite the circumstances even if COVID-19 is in our midst.
A Growth Mindset means we are open to possibilities. It also means we embrace and overcome challenges. It means we put our best effort into all that we do; we learn holistically, and we learn deeply. It means we care about each other and learn from, with, and through each other.
 Let us continue to Soar Towards Excellence by cultivating a Growth Mindset – no challenge too big, no learning too small, no effort negligible. Let us ensure that Everyone & Everything Matters.
 Let’s Strive, Serve, and Soar as one community.</p>
